## Reflection
During this sidequest, I used ChatGPT to better understand how to apply JSON-style level data and expand the excersize so its not a single hard-coded grid. It helped me think through how to structure multiple levels and goal logic more clearly.

I gave it specific instructions about what I wanted the game to do, like having colored circle goals, a Pac-Man style character, and automatic level switching. I used it more as a support tool to figure out structure while still making my own design decisions.

## Description

This sketch expands on the original class example 02 by restructuring the maze using JSON-style.

The player is represented as a Pac-Man style arc that moves using arrow keys. When the player touches a goal circle, it is collected and removed from the grid. Once all goals in a level are collected, the next level automatically loads. After completing all levels, the game displays a completion message.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Generate multiple levels using 2D arrays

- Structure level data using JSON-style objects

- Use nested loops to dynamically render walls, floor tiles, and goal elements

## GenAI

GenAI was used to help refactor and expand the original class example 02 to support JSON-style level data and multiple levels.
The original code came from the class example 02 provided by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han.
